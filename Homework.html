    Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese,
    and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. The term "pizza" was first
    recorded in 997 AD, and it is often associated with the Neapolitan pizza, which features a thin crust and simple
    toppings like tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. Pizza has a rich history, evolving from ancient flatbreads to a global
    culinary sensation, with variations like Margherita pizza and deep-dish pizza popular in the United States. It has
    become one of the most popular foods in the world, enjoyed in various forms and settings, from pizzerias to
    take-and-bake options.
